# A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
# They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

# It must
# be love
# Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

# Love rectangles are defined as hash maps â†´ like this:

#   my_rectangle = {

#     # coordinates of bottom-left corner:
#     'x': 1, 
#     'y': 5, 

#     # width and height
#     'width': 10,
#     'height': 4,

#     }
# Your output rectangle should use this format as well.

# second rectangle coordinates must be
# check if it intersects at all based on x coords
# x <= x_2 <= (x + width) 
# or
# x <= (x_2 + width_2) <= (x + width)
